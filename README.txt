This assignment was to create an assembly using laser-cutting. 

Since I had laser-cut before, I decided to do two projects: on focused on form (the visor) and one focused on engraving (the plaques), since I have not engraved with the laser cutter before. 

The visor was used for a Halloween costume and was flat cut acrylic that I heated and molded. I put the acrylic in the oven at 350 degrees until it was soft and bendable and then I molded it with my hands (wearing gloves) until it was the right shape. I based the pattern off of my own glasses to ensure that they fit. 

The plaques were based on a simple shape that I found online. I had a thin line mimicing the outside shape in order to see what thin engraving looked like in contrast to the thick engraving of the lettering. 

The visor was cut at 100 power, 10 speed. 

The plaques were cut at 90 power, 5 speed and engraved at 80 power, 100 speed.
